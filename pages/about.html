                    <p>Hi, I'm Joshua Rios Galon, 18 years old. Born on the 28th of July, year 2004. My hometown is in Camiguin Island but then now 
                       that i attend college , my parents decided that i should live with my aunt here in Barra, Opol Misamis Oriental to continue 
                        my studies and to fulfill my dreams. I want to be a Entrepreneur, a photographer and a Software Engineer someday.  I'm a 
                        person with a lot of hobbies, some of it are taking pictures, playing guitar, playing sports such as basketball, likes to 
                        listen some musics, podcast and sometimes i read some books but then a lazy behaviour of mine can beat that. I like 
                        spending time alone but i'm actually an extrovert person. And if you want to know more about me, click the button below.</p>
