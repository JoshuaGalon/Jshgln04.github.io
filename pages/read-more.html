                <p>Luckily, in that photo, i was able to achieve "with honors" during my Junior High School Days. Since elementary, i do usually get an academic awards like honors, ribbons and medals. But now in college, i do realize that my trial card has been expired cause right now, i feel like my brain gets crush. I don't know if that affects my Mental Health in the future but hopefully it doesn't.  </p>
